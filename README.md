# Explicit Programming Strategies Study - Replication Guide
This repository contains the replication material for "Explicit Programming Strategies"



The guidelines on how to run the study is described in ReadMe.pdf.

#Study required materials

Please find all the materials required for replicating the Explicit Programming Strategies in the root:
Programming Strategies Pre evaluation tests is used to filter out the very inexperienced users, participants should have pass a pre evaluation test in which they answer a couple of questions. PreTest.pdfincludes the 2 questions we asked from participants ahead of assigning the study.

ControlCondition.pdf is used to run the controlled condition user studies. This version differ from the experimental version in the materials about the StrategyTracker tool.

ExperimentalCondition.pdf is used for experimental user studies who used the implemented stool, STrategyTracker and explicit programming strategies.

Survey.pdf is a google form used to collect participants' experience in designing and debugging skill. The survey answers are used to further make arecord of the participants’ expertise in each task.

Online puzzle game of tower of Hanoi, available at https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html, is used in experimental condition studies for a start up practice. Participants will use this page and the "Towr of Hanoi" strategy as a warm up practice using an explicit strategy in Strategy Tracker tool. 

All the programming strategies used for this study in is availabe in Strategies.pdf.

All the directories of Debugging Task, Design Task, Hello World, JasmineTask, and Lib are available under ExplicitProgStrategiesTestingCode directory.
